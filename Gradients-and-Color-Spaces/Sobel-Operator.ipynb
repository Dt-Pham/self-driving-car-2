    "The Sobel operator is at the heart of the Canny edge detection algorithm you used int he Introductory Lesson. Applying the Sobel operator to an images is a way of taking the derivative of the image in the _x_ or _y_ direction. The operators for _Sobel<sub>x</sub>_ and _Sobel<sub>y</sub>_, respectively, look like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "To understand how these operators take the derivative, you can think of overlaying either one on a 3x3 region of an image. If the imagae is flat across that region (i.e., there is little change in values across the given region), then the result (summing the element-wise product of the operator and corresponding image pizels) will be zero.\n",
